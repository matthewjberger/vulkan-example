# Rust / Vulkan / Egui Example

This is an example of using rust, vulkan, and egui together without using eframe.

## Quickstart

Install `glslangvalidator` and `just`, and then:

```rust
just run
```

This uses Vulkan 1.3 with dynamic rendering, including the features needed for gpu-driven rendering
